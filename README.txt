Quinten McEhiney and Conrad Kuklinsky

This project was a cross-class round-robin AI capture the flag competition. Each team submitted one "myTeam.py" file.

All files except "myTeam.py" are from the competition - "myTeam.py" is the only original code in this repo. This file contains the code for determining agent actions dependent on game state.
